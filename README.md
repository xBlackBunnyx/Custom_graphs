# Custom_graphs
 This is a R package that add a custom theme and a palette set for ggplot2.
 The theme is a variation of the base theme_minimal() that is already in R but with some changes, so it can work without ggplot.
 The palette has a selection of 5 blues, 4 cyan, 5 greens, 5 pinks and 5 purple colours in total.
 There are also combination of these base colors making another palettes to use in your ggplot graphs 
 (the main palette set by default and a mixed palette).
 To install it you should use devtools::instal_github("xBlackBunnyx/Custom_graphs") 
 (You may need to install devtools first in order for this works)
